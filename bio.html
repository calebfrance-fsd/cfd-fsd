		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Caleb, a full stack developer with over five years of experience
				in creating web applications. I work at ABC Inc., where I develop and
				maintain websites and web apps for various clients, using technologies
				such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more. Some
				of my recent projects include a social media platform, an online store,
				and a personal blog. My goal is to create web solutions that are
				user-friendly, responsive, and secure. I’m always eager to learn new
				skills and explore new challenges. I believe in writing clean,
				maintainable, and well-documented code that follows the best practices
				and standards of web development. When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading,
				playing guitar, and traveling. I’m also a fan of sci-fi movies and
				books, and I like to experiment with different cuisines. You can find me
				on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter, or contact me via email.
